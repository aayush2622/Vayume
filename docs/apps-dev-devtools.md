The command-line half of "developer machine" - the tools no single language or editor owns.

## `modules/apps/development/devTools/DevTools.nix`

`git` isn't listed here - it's already installed system-wide, since
flakes need it available regardless of which apps anyone's picked.

`claude-code` is the CLI (`claude`), nixpkgs-packaged - just the binary,
no API key or provider config here. Point it at a provider through
[cc-switch](apps-dev-ccswitch.md) instead of hand-editing
`~/.claude/settings.json`.
