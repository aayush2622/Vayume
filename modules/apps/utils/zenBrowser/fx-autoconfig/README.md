# fx-autoconfig (third-party)

Third-party files, copied in verbatim so the build needs no network and no
hash pinning. Nothing here is this repo's own work.

| Path | Upstream | Revision | Licence |

| this folder | [parazeeknova/doty](https://github.com/parazeeknova/doty), `modules/features/applications/zen/fx-autoconfig` | `11e911a238c74fe40c4ea03acdf3acf7cebce89d` | MIT |

`chrome/utils/` and `program/config.js` originate
from [MrOtherGuy/fx-autoconfig](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/fx-autoconfig)
(**MPL-2.0**) and keep their own file headers - leave those intact.

**Why copied in rather than fetched:** the JS is committed as symlinks into the
author's private dotfiles tree, so it cannot be fetched from `zen-wabi`
directly (GitHub's ZIP export turns the dangling links into text files
containing the link target). `doty` is where the real files live, and it is a
~1.3 GB repository, so pulling it as a flake input to reach ~90 KB of
JavaScript is not worth it.

To update: re-copy from the revision above and bump this table.

## Not a copy

The userChrome / userContent CSS started as
[parazeeknova/zen-wabi](https://github.com/parazeeknova/zen-wabi)
(`4b42ce351504f95de53aaf57d6bf70df85e0dd53`, MIT) but has been reworked into a
colour-only theme that leaves Zen's UI shape untouched. Because it is no longer
a verbatim copy it lives in `../theme/` as this repo's own work, not here.
